            <h3>India Under-19</h3>

            <P>In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series.</P>
        <P>In February-March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.</P>
    <P>Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory. In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).</P>

        <p>In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series. On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.</p>
    <p>When India toured the West Indies in June-July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad. Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings. India went on to win the Test series 1-0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball.</p>
